# RetartedCodes 


These are a bunch of files in *C* and *Java* destinated for really-beginners.
If you're a new to programming the best approach it could be start with java
and this little program files. If you're an intermediate or just want to get
sharped into Algorithms & DataStructures get directly to C files. 
Anyways *all roads lead to Rome*
Just enjoy the ride and gets your hands dirty.  


## Test
**As you may could know now, all the stuff that you are going to develop needs be tested, because we don't want to know a week, month later when our minds almost forgot what it was, so give you a peacefully life an test 
and for all the community and do testing ;) .**
